It can be purchased as a stand-alone product or included in the Creative Suite or Creative Cloud families.

If you purchased a downloadable version, follow the instructions included with the download for launching the installation process.

        <h1>Getting started</h1>
            <p>Video effects can be used for many reasons. They can solve problems with image quality (such as exposure or color balance). They can create complex images through compositing using techniques such as chromakeying. They can also be used to solve a variety of production problems such as camera vibration and rolling shutter. Effects can also be used for stylistic purposes. You can alter the color or distort footage. You can animate the size and position of a clip within the frame.
</p>
            <h1>Working with effects</h1>
            <p>Adobe Premiere Pro makes working with effects easy. You can drag an effect to a clip, or you can select the clip and double-click the effect in the Effects Browser. You can combine as many effects as you want on a single clip, which can produce surprising results. Moreover, you can use an adjustment layer to add the same effects to a collection of clips. When it comes to choosing which video effects to use, the choices in Adobe Premiere Pro can be a bit overwhelming. The application has more than 100 builtin effects. Several effects are also available from third-party manufacturers for sale or free download. It’s important to understand how effects are treated in Adobe Premiere Pro.
            </p>
            <h1>the effects Browser</h1>
            <p>Besides the fixed effects you’ve already explored, Adobe Premiere Pro has standard effects. You’ll use standard effects to affect a clip’s image quality and appearance. Because you’ll have more than 100 effects to choose from, Adobe Premiere Pro attempts to simplify the process by organizing them. You’ll find 16 standard categories (third-party effects may add more choices). These categories group effects into logical tasks such as Distort, Keying, and Time. This makes it easier to choose the correct effect that you want to apply. </p>
